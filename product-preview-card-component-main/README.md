## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Responsive Design: Had a more detailed understanding of the techniques to ensure elements adjust well on different screen sizes, such as adjusting container dimensions and handling image replacements for mobile views.

CSS Styling: I looked at CSS properties like max-width, max-height, and overflow to manage container size and content overflow issues.

Project README: Having to get used to documenting and explaing my jorney through each project, is a huge milestone for me.




### Continued development
Focus on understand responsive design and perfecting creating them.
